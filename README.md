# Alien Art Creator
A really simple tool I whipped up to create "alien art". Inspired by [this Hackaday article](https://hackaday.com/2021/04/13/alien-art-drawn-with-surprisingly-simple-math/), think of alien art as a bytebeat but for images.

The tool takes a formula in the form of a JavaScript expression, and applies it to each pixel in an image. The formula is provided the x and y coordinates of the pixel it's running on, named `x` and `y` respectively. The image dimensions, scale, and colors can be updated to fit your needs. 

Have fun!
